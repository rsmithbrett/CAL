# CAL / App test plan

This file is the firmware half of the project's testing rule. The rule is that a
change is validated by an automated test wherever one is possible, and that
where it is not, the manual procedure is written down instead of being left in
somebody's head.

**Almost nothing in this repository can have an automated test, and this file
exists to be honest about that rather than to hide it.** The App is an Arduino
sketch cross-compiled for an ESP32-WROOM-32E; its behaviour is a function of a
real heap, a real TLS stack, a real NVS partition, a real 2.8" panel and a real
server on the other end of a real network. There is no host-runnable test
target, no injectable clock, and no seam between the watchdogs and
`esp_restart()`. A clean `arduino-cli compile` proves that the code builds and
that a string is present in the image. It proves nothing else, and every commit
message in this repository that says "verified" means exactly that unless it
also names a device.

The server's own `TEST_PLAN.md` (in the DiscoverAroundMe repository) covers
everything on the other side of the wire - the check-in gateway, telemetry
ingestion, the firmware catalog, `/diag`. Where a firmware behaviour has a
server-side consequence it is noted here and tracked there.

## How to observe anything at all

Every procedure below depends on one of these three channels, so they are worth
stating once.

1. **The remote debug stream.** The only diagnostic channel a deployed device
   has. Toggled per device from the server and mirrored back on every check-in
   response, so it takes up to one check-in interval to come on. Everything the
   watchdogs decide is logged there with its numbers, including the branches
   that decide to do nothing - that is a standing requirement in this codebase,
   not a nicety, and several of the checks below consist of reading a line that
   says why something did *not* happen.
   **Note the stream is itself a heap consumer** - the measured ratchet in the
   `HeapRatchet` investigation was the stream - so a test that needs both the
   stream and a low-heap condition is not measuring an untouched device.
2. **A USB serial console.** Sees boot lines the stream cannot, because the
   stream is not up yet. The only way to read the `[boot] restart reason` pair
   and the `[health]` seeding line on the boot immediately after a self-restart.
   Note that opening a serial port with DTR asserted resets this board, which
   destroys the state most of these procedures are trying to observe - open the
   port first, then cause the condition.
3. **`/diag` on the server**, for telemetry, the reboot heatmap and the retained
   card status line. This is where a *misreported* fault shows up, and several
   of the changes below are about the label rather than the action.

---

## 1. The self-restart backoff (this pass)

`selfRestartFloorMs()` in `App.ino`. Twenty minutes doubling to a four-hour
ceiling - 20, 40, 80, 160, 240, 240... - stepped by the connection watchdog and
the response-OOM watchdog, cleared only by a completed check-in. See the
README's "The unreachable watchdog rebooted on the same cadence forever".

**Automated coverage: none, and none is possible in this repository.** The
schedule is a pure function of one `uint8_t` and `millis()`, which is testable
in principle - but nothing in this tree can host a test, and extracting the
function to something that could would mean building a host test target for a
seven-line function. The judgement is that the log lines below are the cheaper
proof.

### 1a. The ladder actually doubles

The honest version of this test takes just over five hours, so do it in two
parts.

**Short form (bench, ~20 minutes), with a scratch build.** Temporarily set
`kBaseMsBetweenSelfRestarts` to 60,000 and `kMaxMsBetweenSelfRestarts` to
480,000 in a build that is never registered in the firmware catalog. Then:

1. Provision a device normally and let it complete at least one check-in.
2. Make the server unreachable *without* making WiFi drop - the watchdog
   declines outright if WiFi is not associated, so pulling the AP tests nothing.
   Stopping the Host process is the cleanest; a DNS override that resolves the
   service name to an unroutable address also works and is closer to the field
   failure.
3. Watch the stream. Expect `[checkin] failure N of 5`, then the restart line
   naming `self-restart 1 of this run` and a next-gap of 60,000 ms.
4. Across the next four restarts, the gap named on each restart line must read
   60,000 / 120,000 / 240,000 / 480,000 / 480,000. The hold-off line between
   them must name the same figure and say how many doublings produced it.
5. Confirm the hold-off line appears **once per episode**, not once per loop
   iteration. A flood here is a regression of `gHoldOffLogged` and has happened
   before.

**Long form (one real overnight run, no scratch build).** Same setup on shipping
constants. Record restart timestamps from the reboot heatmap on `/diag`. Expect
restarts at roughly T+5 min, +25 min, +65 min, +145 min, +305 min, then every
240 min. This is the run that proves the shipped constants, and it is the only
one that does; the short form proves the shape.

### 1b. A completed check-in resets it, and nothing weaker does

1. Drive a device to at least self-restart 3 (floor 80 minutes) using 1a.
2. Bring the server back. On the next check-in the stream must print
   `[checkin] a complete round trip after 3 self-restart(s) in this run - the
   backoff is reset to its 1200000 ms base`.
3. Power-cycle the device and confirm the boot no longer prints the
   `[health] last restart was ...` hold-off seeding line with a raised floor -
   the NVS key `rstbackoff` must be back to 0.
4. **The negative half, which is the point.** Repeat from step 1, but instead of
   bringing the server back, restore only DNS and the TCP listener while keeping
   the API refusing (a listener that accepts and immediately closes, or a TLS
   port answering with a rejected certificate). `Http::diagnoseFailure()` will
   report the name resolving and the connect succeeding. The backoff must
   **not** reset: the next hold-off line must still name the raised floor. This
   is the scenario a well-meaning "reset on any sign of life" would break, and
   it is the exact shape of the poisoned-TLS-client fault.

### 1c. A maintenance window does not touch the schedule *via this watchdog*

Note the scoping in that heading. "A window does not step the backoff" is the
tempting summary and it is **false**: the response-OOM watchdog is deliberately
not suppressed by a window (see 4b step 6) and it steps the same counter, so a
device that runs out of heap during a deploy restarts and steps the ladder inside
the window. What is being tested here is the connection watchdog, which cannot
restart inside a window and therefore cannot step it. Test 1c-ii covers the
other half.

1. Drive a device to self-restart 2 (floor 40 minutes).
2. With the server still up, declare a maintenance window
   (`maintenance_until_utc`) far enough out to cover the test, then take the
   server down.
3. The stream must print the maintenance suppression line, and that line must
   name the current floor and the step count. It must say "nothing **here**
   steps the backoff" rather than claiming the window freezes the schedule
   outright. No restart may occur for the whole window, however long it runs.
4. Let the window expire with the server still down. The next restart must use
   the floor from step 1 - the window must not have advanced the ladder (this
   watchdog did not restart, so nothing here stepped) and must not have reset it.
5. Check the clock-skew guard while here: set the device's clock behind the
   server's and confirm the device still enforces its own expiry rather than
   trusting the server's.
6. **The provably-cannot-reconnect path is suppressed too, and that is the
   deliberate part.** With a window declared, drive the device below
   `Http::kTlsRecordBufferBytes` contiguous (recipe in 4a) so
   `Http::canOpenNewSession()` is false while check-ins are failing. This is a
   proven *local* fault that the window does not explain, and the device must
   still not restart: a restart cannot reach a server that is down, so it would
   spend a backoff step on an attempt doomed before it began. Confirm the restart
   happens promptly once the window closes, with the step count unchanged by the
   window.

### 1c-ii. The response-OOM watchdog *does* step the ladder inside a window

The counterpart to 1c, and the one that proves the scoping above is real rather
than a caveat nobody checked.

1. Declare a maintenance window.
2. Reproduce the low-heap-response condition inside it (4a).
3. The device must restart (per 4b step 6) **and** the restart line must show the
   step count advancing. On the next boot the raised floor must be in force.
4. Confirm the connection watchdog's suppression line, if it also appears, does
   not claim the window left the schedule untouched.

### 1d. The response-OOM watchdog shares the schedule

1. Force the low-heap-response condition (see 4 below).
2. Confirm the restart line from `checkResponseOomWatchdog()` names
   `self-restart N of this run` with N continuing the *same* run as any
   connection-watchdog restarts, not restarting from 1.
3. Alternate the two faults and confirm the floor keeps climbing across both.

### 1d-ii. A second OOM hold-off episode still explains itself

A regression test for a latch defect found on 2026-09-14 while checking this
change: `gHoldOffLogged` is one flag shared by both watchdogs' hold-off lines,
and `performCheckIn()` cleared it from the connection-recovery branch only. Since
`92cc034` deliberately keeps a `NoMemory` parse failure *out* of
`gConsecutiveCheckInFailures`, an episode that came purely through the OOM path
left that branch untaken and the latch stuck true for the rest of the boot -
after which every later OOM hold-off held off in complete silence. The backoff
makes that worse rather than better, because hold-off episodes are now both
longer and more numerous.

1. Drive a device through one OOM hold-off so the hold-off line appears once.
2. Let a check-in succeed. The stream must print
   `[checkin] response parsed after N out-of-heap failure(s)`.
3. Drive it into a **second** OOM hold-off. The hold-off line must appear again.
   Before the fix it never did, and the device declined to reboot in silence.
4. Confirm it still appears only once per episode, not once per loop iteration -
   the fix must not undo the latch, only reopen it.

### 1e. A power cycle gets one free attempt

1. Drive a device to a raised floor and leave it holding off.
2. Pull power and restore it.
3. On the serial console, the boot must print the "recorded in this backoff run,
   but the restart that led to this boot was neither watchdog's" line, and must
   **not** seed the hold-off clock.
4. The next watchdog trigger must fire at the ordinary five-failure threshold
   with no wait, and the restart after it must name a step count that continued
   the run rather than restarting it.

### Known gap

The RAM mirror of the step count and the NVS write are not atomic. Power lost in
the few instructions between them costs one shorter floor. Not tested, not worth
testing, recorded so nobody reports it as a defect.

## 2. The mbedTLS figure is 16,717 contiguous, twice - not "~32KB" (`3cfbb08`)

A documentation correction with no runtime component, which makes it the one
item here where "read the code" is a complete test. What matters is that the
wrong figure routes a reader to the wrong work.

1. `grep -rn "32KB" .` across the repository. Every remaining hit must be either
   (a) inside an explicitly-labelled superseded block that says so, or (b) a
   statement about the 33,434-byte **total** that cannot be misread as a
   contiguity requirement. There must be no unqualified "needs roughly 32KB
   contiguous" left anywhere, in Markdown, in a workflow file or in a comment.
2. `Http::kTlsRecordBufferBytes` must be the single definition of the number.
   **This is currently aspirational and the tree does not meet it** - checked
   2026-09-14, `grep -rn 16717 App/` finds three other sites:
   - `App/SdStorage.cpp:144`, a live `largestAfterMount >= 16717` **comparison**.
     This is the one that matters: it is a second definition of the figure that
     decides whether the mount log says the device can open a TLS session, and
     nothing makes it follow `kTlsRecordBufferBytes` if that constant ever
     changes. `SdStorage.cpp` does not include `Http.h`, which is why it was
     written as a literal; fixing it means either that include or lifting the
     figure somewhere both can see. Left alone here rather than folded into an
     unrelated change.
   - `App/SdStorage.cpp:140` and `App/BootDiag.cpp:184` and
     `App/HeapRatchet.cpp:146`, all inside log-string prose. Harmless to
     behaviour, still a figure that can drift out of step with the constant.

   Re-check this step after any change to `kTlsRecordBufferBytes`, and treat the
   `SdStorage.cpp:144` comparison as the acceptance criterion for closing it.
3. **The arithmetic worth re-deriving at the bench once**, because it is what
   the correction is for: a device sitting at largest8 = 21,000 satisfies the
   *first* record buffer and still cannot complete a handshake, because the
   second needs another 16,717 contiguous and the first has just been carved out
   of the only block that size. Confirm against a card-less device (which sits
   at largest8 21,000-26,000 while drawing nothing) that handshakes fail with
   `MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_ALLOC_FAILED` at that figure. On the old framing those
   devices "obviously" lacked memory; on the correct one it takes the two-buffer
   argument to explain them, and if that argument is wrong the whole watchdog
   design is built on sand.
4. The workflow header's second correction - that
   `MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_FRAGMENT_LENGTH` **is** compiled into the shipped core but
   is inert because `MBEDTLS_SSL_VARIABLE_BUFFER_LENGTH` is not set - is
   checkable without hardware: grep the installed core's `mbedtls/esp_config.h`
   for the first symbol and the shipped `sdkconfig` for the second. Do this
   again after any core version bump, because the conclusion is version-specific
   and the file says so.

## 3. Listings tells "none for sale" apart from "could not ask" (`902fc69`)

`Status::RefreshFailed` on `Listings::Result`, plus the removal of a raw
upstream error from a drawn string.

**Automated coverage:** the server side of this is covered by
`Providers.Tests` / `MyListingsServiceTests` in the DiscoverAroundMe repository,
which is what puts `lastRefreshError` on the wire. Nothing tests the card.

### 3a. The three empty states draw three different things

Requires a device with the listings card in its policy, and server-side control
of the RentCast key.

1. **Genuinely empty.** A valid key and a search area with no matches. Expect
   "No listings nearby right now" - the only case licensed to say that.
2. **Refresh failed.** Set an invalid key so the server's refresh 401s while
   still answering the check-in normally. Expect "Could not check for listings"
   over "The listings near <area> could not be refreshed just now". Expect it
   **resting, not amber**.
3. **Not configured.** Remove the key entirely. Expect a fixed sentence.
4. In cases 2 and 3, **photograph the screen** and confirm the words
   "rentcast.io", "API key", "MyListings" and any HTTP status code appear
   nowhere on it. This is the actual regression being guarded: a household read
   a vendor's sign-up instructions off a kitchen wall.
5. Confirm the same error text **is** present in the debug stream and on
   `/diag`'s status line for that card, truncated to 120 characters. Suppressing
   it from the screen while also losing it would be a worse outcome than the
   leak.
6. Declare a maintenance window while the key is invalid. The card must keep
   saying "could not be refreshed" - **not** "server maintenance". Our server is
   answering fine; it is RentCast that is not, and relabelling that as our
   downtime is a new false claim replacing the old one.
7. Rows present alongside an error: confirm the card still draws the rows and
   says nothing about the error. Deliberate.

### 3b. Known gaps, unfixed, verified as still present

These are the two findings from the survey done alongside `902fc69`. **Both are
open.** Each step below is expected to FAIL today; they are written as tests so
the fix, when it comes, has an acceptance criterion, and so nobody rediscovers
them from scratch.

- **Aircraft, same leak, arguably worse.** `AircraftResult` carries
  `LastRefreshError` on the wire; `Aircraft.cpp`'s ArduinoJson filter does not
  whitelist it, so the card cannot read it even to log it; and the empty path
  draws **"No aircraft within 10 mi right now"** - a flat claim about the sky
  made by a device that may have been told nothing about the sky. Worse than the
  listings case in one respect: an empty sky is plausible far more often than an
  empty housing market, so nobody in the room will question it. *Test, once
  fixed:* break the aircraft feed server-side and confirm the card stops
  claiming the sky is empty.
- **Forecast, softer form.** `WeatherResult` carries the field, the filter does
  not, and the empty path says "No forecast is available yet" - which asserts
  nothing about the weather, so only the diagnostic half is missing. *Test, once
  fixed:* break the weather feed and confirm the reason reaches the stream.
- **Tides and HomeValue cannot have this.** Neither fetches; both arrive
  flattened on the check-in response with no error field on the wire, and
  HomeValue drops its card entirely rather than drawing a claim. No test needed,
  recorded so the survey is not repeated.

Note both open fixes need a filter entry added before the field is readable at
all, and the filter is what decides how much heap the parse takes. That is why
neither was smuggled into the listings change.

---

## 4. A device out of heap restarts as `LOW_HEAP_RESPONSE`, not `UNREACHABLE` (`92cc034`)

The action was always right and the stated cause was always wrong: a
`deserializeJson()` `NoMemory` fed the connection watchdog's counter, so a
device that had reached the server, authenticated and been answered in full
reported a connectivity incident.

### 4a. Producing the condition

This is the hardest state on this page to create deliberately. The reliable
recipe is to make the check-in response large and the heap small at the same
time:

1. Use a device **with no SD card**, so every graphic falls back to a RAM buffer
   held for the process lifetime.
2. Turn the debug stream **on** and leave it on - it is a known heap consumer
   and was the ratchet the `HeapRatchet` work identified.
3. Give the device a policy with several graphic cards and a long announcement
   queue, so the check-in response is at the large end.
4. Let it run. Watch largest8 in the `[health]` line decay.

### 4b. What must be observed

1. `[checkin] out of heap parsing the response, N of 3 ... NOT counted toward
   the unreachable threshold`. The count must be the OOM counter, and the
   connection counter must stay where it was.
2. `err.c_str()` must name `NoMemory` specifically, with largest8 and free heap
   beside it. A response that is genuinely malformed must still print its own
   `DeserializationError` code and must **not** touch the OOM counter - test
   this separately by having the server return truncated JSON.
3. `Graphic::releaseRamBuffers()` must run on the first occurrence only.
   Confirm from largest8 jumping once and from the pictures re-fetching.
4. At the third consecutive OOM the device restarts. On the serial console the
   next boot must read `SOFTWARE_RESET + LOW_HEAP_RESPONSE` - not
   `UNREACHABLE`, and not the bare `LOW_HEAP` the draw watchdog uses.
5. On `/diag`, telemetry must carry `LOW_HEAP_RESPONSE` and the reboot heatmap
   must sort it as a **recovery** restart, not as an unknown reason. This works
   without a server change because the token contains `LOW_HEAP` and
   `RebootHeatmap.Classify()` already keys on that - confirm it, because it is a
   dependency on a server implementation detail that nothing enforces.
6. **The maintenance-window difference, deliberately opposite to the connection
   watchdog.** Declare a window and reproduce the OOM condition inside it. This
   watchdog must still fire. A declared window explains a silent server and
   explains nothing about this device's heap.

---

## 5. `HeapRatchet` names the boot, and the identity now needs six buckets (`02d696c`)

### 5a. On the device

1. With the debug stream off (the stream is the thing being measured, so a run
   with it on measures the instrument), let a device run for at least 15 minutes
   after boot.
2. From the telemetry report, confirm the six buckets sum to
   `bootLargestFreeBlockBytes - largestFreeBlock8BitBytes` exactly. Any
   discrepancy means a phase is missing a scope, and the instrument is designed
   to be caught this way.
3. Confirm `heapPhaseBootBytes` stops changing the moment `setup()` returns -
   compare two consecutive reports.
4. Confirm the splash PNG decode (~45,056 bytes on device 17) lands in **Boot**
   and not in **Idle**. Before this change it was in Idle and made the ~2KB that
   was the real background answer invisible.
5. Confirm `heapRatchetSteps` no longer counts the check-in/service transient
   pair. A run with no genuine decay should report a step count of zero, not two
   per check-in.

### 5b. The wire change, which breaks on the server

**This is a firmware-to-server contract change and the symptom appears on the
server.** A reader still summing five buckets will come up short by whatever
`setup()` cost - most of the session total on device 17 - and the identity check
will fail while the firmware is right.

1. Confirm `heapPhaseBootBytes` is present on the telemetry POST and is sent
   first.
2. **Server side, tracked in the DiscoverAroundMe repository, not fixable from
   here:** the bucket identity check must learn the sixth field, and must
   tolerate its absence so a device still running older firmware does not read
   as broken.
3. Until that lands, treat a failing identity check on `/diag` as expected and
   check the reading end first. This step exists to save the fifteen minutes
   somebody would otherwise spend looking for a firmware bug.

## What a clean compile does and does not prove

Recorded once, because several commits in this repository lean on it:

- It proves the code builds against the pinned core and libraries, and it
  reports a size. Report sizes against the **real** `ota_0` ceiling from
  `partitions.csv` - 2,424,832 bytes - never against `arduino-cli`'s generic
  1,966,080, which is for a partition scheme this project does not use.
- `strings` on the built image proves a literal is present. That is a real check
  and worth doing when a change is "the card must now be able to say X".
- It proves nothing about heap, TLS, NVS, timing, the panel, or any decision
  taken at runtime. Every item on this page is on this page for that reason.
